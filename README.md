## How to Execute:
1. To run, cd to the working directory and execute:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
2. Navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:5005/" on your browser.
3. Only an admin can create more admins. <br>
To create your first admin, open Postman or any similar software and execute the following POST command:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5003/signUp?user_name=<enter_admin_username>&first_name=<enter_first_name>&last_name=<enter_last_name>&date_of_birth=<enter_in_YYYY-MM-DD_format>&phone_number=<enter_10digit_number>&address=<enter_address>&email=<enter_valid_email_id_for_admin>&password=<enter_admin_password>&admin_status=True
```
4. Once you log in as a user/admin and create an item, it is defaulted to the "Buy Now" feature. If you want to push the item for auction, please enter the corresponding "Item ID" and press the "Add for Auction" button. Now navigate to the "Auction" portal and continue.

5. Once you're done, Ctrl+C to stop the server. Once this is done, the data will no longer persist. The execute the following to take down the containers.
```
docker-compose down
```
